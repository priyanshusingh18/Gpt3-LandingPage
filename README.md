GPT3 LANDING PAGE


# Project Description

This is a landing page for a Ai tech start-up: GPT3. 
The Ui is borrowed from a figma  design.
Made with React and CSS

# What i learned

My first project with a strict design, it's much tougher to copy the
exact same deisgn with no room for deviation than just
taking an inspiration from a design and molding it according to
our needs and capablities. 

The design was not responsive, so i had to use the power of imagination 
and creativity to make it responsive.
